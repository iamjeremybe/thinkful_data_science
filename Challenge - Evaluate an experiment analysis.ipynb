    "### 1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.\n",

They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.\n",

When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to \"opt in\" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.\n",

If you looked at the one that tracks the number of steps I take per day, back when I was working a full-time job and walking between bus stops, and my home and office, you would conclude that I am not usually as active on weekends. However, on weekends--seasonally--I am not walking because I am biking everywhere instead.\n",

I take winters off from biking outdoors, because I live in Minnesota and don't want to take a chance on road conditions, on roads narrowed by accumulated, plowed snow.

    "\n",
    "If I began using the Happy Days Fitness Tracker in spring, and it tracked my bike rides, there _would_ be a steady increase in the amount of time I spend on the bike as I trained up, and those increased levels would last through the end of the summer. If I downloaded this app mid-summer, my recorded biking activity levels would decrease as winter approached. In the winter, as far as this app knows if it's only tracking bike rides, I would be almost completely sedentary except for an hour or two a week when I spin indoors and catch up on Netflix.\n",

    "I spend more time weightlifting and doing other kinds of cardio in the winter.\n",

    "In summer when I'm biking a lot, I don't want to wreck my legs in weightlifting class twice a week, so I switch to yoga instead. If I downloaded this app in the autumn, it would show an increase in the amount of weightlifting I do through the winter, but a marked decrease in the amount of time I spent doing yoga.\n",
