    "### Data Source: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?\n",
    "* This data only represents one day out of the year. \n",
    "* That single day is also Christmas Eve. With families visiting for Christmas, and people on winter vacation, availability is probably not representative of a typical day.\n",
    "#### Gather data for additional days, ideally an entire year at least...?\n",

    "### Data Source: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?\n",
    "* Again, this data only represents one day--and only two cities.\n",
    "* Just guessing that this day was VERY stressful for New Yorkers.\n",
    "#### Gather data for a period of time away from an international disaster, and for more cities. Maybe choose a few from \"flyover country\" to even out the coastal bias?\n",

    "### Data Source: Armenian Pub Survey. (https://www.kaggle.com/erikhambardzumyan/pubs) Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?\n",
    "* Data set skews heavily toward young people (70% students).\n",
    "* Data set heavily favors respondents who live in the capital. (A quick Wikipedia search shows that the capital's population averages ~5+ times that of the other ten Armenian provinces, so maybe this is representative of the country as a whole?)\n",
    "* Data set also favors women, 58% to  42% men. Another quick web search (https://www.indexmundi.com/armenia/demographics_profile.html) states that the population ratio for ages 15-24 (so the overwhelming majority of survey respondents) is 1.06 male. \n",
    "#### Limit the conclusions: the reasons younger, female students living in the capital visit local pubs.\n",
