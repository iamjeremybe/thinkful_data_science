    "My parents still live in the bedroom community in which I was raised, in north central Iowa. On a trip home this summer, my dad and I talked about the large number of windmills that have popped up in the farmland south of town in the past decade (I have since learned these windmills are collectively named the [Lundgren Project](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/viewer/#11.76/42.3582/-94.1259)). Dad and I wondered how these fields were chosen as a location for so many windmills.\n"

    "At least four major factors come into play when siting a wind project, according to the [American Wind Energy Association](https://www.awea.org/wind-101/siting-a-project). Scope and data availability may limit the number of factors actually used in this capstone:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Strong and consistent winds;__\n",
    "2. __Large, open space, such as agricultural land.__ [NREL has datasets](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/data-wind.html) featuring “wind power classes” derived from both mean wind speeds and basic topographic features--the shapefile that includes data for the entire US, excluding areas unsuited to wind farm construction due to topography, will be used here. If found, additional data about topography and population density may also be sourced, but the US dataset “with exclusions” has already removed “protected areas (wilderness, wildlife refuges, parks, etc.), incompatible land use (wetlands, urban areas), and other criteria from the available wind resource”;\n",
    "3. __Minimal risk to wildlife.__ This includes both birds and bats, [which can be especially hard-hit by poorly tuned wind farms](http://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2017/03/wind-energy-bat-deaths); use data for migratory bird/bat populations, or locations of flyways, and see which areas have a higher population density--[the US Fish and Wildlife Service](https://www.fws.gov/birds/management/flyways.php) has basic shape files outlining the four main flyways of the continental US, but does not further break them down to specific flight paths. The more I read about this factor, the more it felt that it was a topic of research for each proposed wind project and unfortunately does not immediately lend itself well to automation/machine learning;\n",
    "4. __Community acceptance.__ If written community survey/commentary was available for an area, sentiment analysis could help determine acceptance. Lacking available data, I scanned Twitter hashtags ([#windpower](https://twitter.com/hashtag/windpower?lang=en), [#windenergy](https://twitter.com/hashtag/windenergy?lang=en), [#windfarm](https://twitter.com/hashtag/windfarm?lang=en)) hoping to find discussions that could be analyzed instead. Unfortunately, I mostly found wind energy company tweets, and retweets by proponents. Wind farm opponents were typically found outside of the US. In a recent example that generated some discussion, a wind project already underway in Ontario, Canada was halted, and the partially-completed construction removed from the site, [over concerns about the impact of the project on the local bat population](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/ontario-cancels-nearly-built-200m-wind-farm-over-threat-to-bat-populations).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Additional factors could include:__\n",
    "* __Proximity to transmission lines that can carry the generated power to customers__ (data available as a shapefile on the [Homeland Infrastructure Foundation website](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/electric-power-transmission-lines));\n",
    "* __Placement to minimize “shadow flicker”__, the repetitive shadow cast on nearby homes and business by rotating blades, usually during sunrise and sunset. Given the height of an average windmill and the location of the sun on the horizon at sunrise/sunset throughout an average year, some basic calculations could define a buffer zone that would guarantee shadow flicker from a given windmill is minimized. This may be too much detail for this capstone, but in a more advanced version of this tool, a site such as [suncalc.org](https://www.suncalc.org/#/44.9537,-93.2199,3/2019.12.12/19:48/1/3) (and its [API](https://www.torsten-hoffmann.de/apis/suncalcmooncalc/link_en.html)) may be able to provide the information about the sun’s angles relative to the horizon throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWEA goes into more detail about the overall resource assessment process [here](http://awea.org/wind-101/siting-a-project/resource-assessment). CRC Press also has [an article about siting wind farms](https://www.crcpress.com/blog/article/how-to-select-a-location-for-a-wind-farm), though unfortunately links to some of their suggested data sources appear to be stale.\n"

    "Another useful feature will be based on the distance between a given cell and suitable transmission lines. The ability to piggyback on existing infrastructure can cut the costs for a new wind project. States east of the Mississippi River will have the easiest time here, despite having few sites with an NREL wind class of 3 or above. Parts of the West (roughly Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado) will have longer mean distances to transmission lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to create some kind of weight based on density of transmission lines, in addition to measuring proximity. My idea is that being close to more lines is better, but only to a point--past this point, a density of transmission lines probably indicates high population density (see: [the Northeast megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalopolis#/media/File:BosWash-Night-Labeled.png)). Proximity should be penalized in this case."
