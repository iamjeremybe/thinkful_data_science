    "Let's assume our goal is to identify spam (rather than identify ham).\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, when we talk about errors in a binary classifier (where there are only two outcomes) we're generally referring to two kinds of errors. A __false positive__ is when we identify something as spam that is not. In this case we had 55 of these. This is sometimes also called a \"Type I Error\" or a \"false alarm\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A __false negative__ is therefore when we mistakenly identify something as not spam when it is. We had 549 of these. This is also called a \"Type II Error\" or a \"miss\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This also brings us to a conversation of sensitivity vs specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sensitivity__ is the percentage of positives correctly identified, in our case 198/747 or 27%. This shows how good we are at catching positives, or how sensitive our model is to identifying positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Specificity__ is just the opposite, the percentage of negatives correctly identified, 4770/4825 or 99%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again this confirms that we're not great at identifying spam, though we do label ham quite accurately. You should get familiar with these terms as in the practicing world they will often be used with little explanation and you will be expected to understand them.\n",
